A little game.

- Player must guess a number between min and max;
- Player gets a certain amount of guesses
- Notify player of guesses remaining
- Notify the player of the correct answer if loose;
- Let player choose to play again.

Use Skeleton CSS boilerplate.

In JS used Math.random to generate random winning number.
When the game is over I used window.location.reload() method.
